I create this project as I want to know if there  some cheap flights to some cities of Japan in the incomming weekends.

There are three major LCCs which I'm planning to support in this project:

| Airline                                           | Status             |
|---------------------------------------------------| :---:              |
| [Peach](https://booking.flypeach.com/tw/search)   | :white_check_mark: |
| [Vanilla](https://www.vanilla-air.com/tw/)        | In Progress        |
| [Tiger](https://www.tigerairtw.com/zh-tw/)        | :x:                |


Feel free to ask for features!
